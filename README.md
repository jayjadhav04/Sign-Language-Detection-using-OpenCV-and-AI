# Sign-Language-Detection-using-OpenCV-and-AI
This project enables real-time sign language recognition using a webcam, OpenCV, and a deep learning model. It captures hand gestures, processes them, and classifies them into predefined sign language categories. 

Key Features:
📸 Data Collection – Captures and stores images of hand signs for training.
🎯 AI-Based Recognition – Uses a trained deep learning model to classify gestures.
🖥️ Real-Time Detection – Recognizes and displays signs instantly.
🔥 User-Friendly Interface – Simple keyboard controls for collecting and testing signs.
